# Ridge Regression Analysis - Assignment 1 1This repository contains Python code for performing ridge regression analysis on multiple datasets. Includes functions for ridge regression, mean squared error calculations, data loading, cross-validation, and plotting. The script its aimed at analyzing and visualizing the performance of ridge regression on different datasets. It also includes cross-validation, bias-variance decomposition, and various visualizations.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) (Python IDE)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the `HMW1DM24.py` script.

2. Open Spyder and navigate to the directory containing the `HMW1DM24.py` script.

3. Open the script in Spyder.

4. Run the script:

   - Select the entire script (press `Ctrl + A`).
   - Right-click on the selected code.
   - Choose "Run Selection or Current Line" from the context menu.

5. Observe the output:

   The script will process multiple datasets, perform ridge regression analysis, and display relevant information, including the best lambda values, bias, variance, and test mean squared errors. Plots will be generated to visualize the results.

## Configuration

You can customize the script by modifying parameters within the code. Look for sections such as `num_samples` and `lambda_values` and adjust them according to your preferences.

## Important Notes

- Figures are displayed in the Plots pane by default. To make them also appear inline in the console, you need to uncheck "Mute inline plotting" under the options menu of Plots.
